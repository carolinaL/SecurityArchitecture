# Dead simple security checklist 

Simple is hard. Especially to manage and mitigate cyber security risks. The context of cyber security problems consist of a mix of:
* People
* Complicated hardware and software
* Continues changes on all aspects involved
* Organizations 
* Internal and external threads
Putting a complex cyber security product in such a context is asking for failures. Stupid simple procedures and awareness trainings are often as good or better than complex and expensive cyber security products to mitigate risks. 


A good cyber simple solution:
* Does not reinvent the wheel.  
* Is open source ([FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software)). 
* Ensures that product and process quality aspects can be inspected.
* Follow the principles of reproducible build.
* Meets one or more open security standards that you can verify.

A simple Cyber security product has:
1. Zero manual configuration challenges
2. Zero manual maintenance
3. Minimal dependencies and
4. Is created to do one thing, and only one thing, good!

A good simple cyber security products works without unnecessary additions and modifications in your perimeter. 

```{attention} 
**"The central enemy of reliability is complexity."**
```


Simplicity is the primary cyber security principle. All other principles must be sacrificed in favor of design simplicity. 


```{tip} Zero Complexity by design
A nice reference to avoid complexity when designing solutions can be found in the [0Complexity design principles manifest](https://nocomplexity.com/documents/0complexity/0cxdesignprinciples.html)
