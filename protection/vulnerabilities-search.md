# Find vulnerabilities 

Periodic searching for new vulnerabilities for your used software and hardware is crucial. 

You SHOULD check vulnerabilities: 
* Regularly.
* When system is updated with new functionality.
* When significant security events in commonly used libraries are discovered. This to check if you are more vulnerable to.
* When infrastructure changes. E.g. new hardware or networking components.
* When evaluating new software. 

When a new CVE is out you are vulnerable. It does not matter if exploit code is already published on the Internet or not. Assume that Criminals are misusing the CVEs already.

A simple way to search for vulnerabilities is using `Search` option that the US National Vulnerability Database (NVD) offers. The NVD is a product of the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology).
