Since our founding in 2004, The Shadowserver Foundation has become one of the world’s leading resources for Internet security reporting and malicious activity investigation. When we started, we were staffed entirely by volunteers. Today, we employ a full-time team and maintain a global infrastructure spanning 80 countries.
Shadowserver scans the entire IPv4 Internet for over 100 different network protocols every day, and also performs IPv6 scans based on IPv6 hitlists for selected protocols. These are “hello” type port scans that do not exploit any vulnerability.
