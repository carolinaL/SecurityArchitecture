# Cryptography

Using cryptographic protection for data in transit or in rest lowers risks.
However using cryptography correct is often not so simple.
This sections is an opinionated collection of open references to help you protect against cryptography attacks.

- [Timing attacks](https://timing.attacks.cr.yp.to/basics.html) : Timing attacks extract your confidential data from observations of the time used by your computer. Timing attacks have been demonstrated again and again to successfully extract complete cryptographic keys and other secrets. This is aimed at end users, operating-system distributors, CPU manufacturers, and software engineers who would like to know what they can do to protect data against timing attacks.
